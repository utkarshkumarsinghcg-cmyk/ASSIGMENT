    <samll>The first introduction of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_fund"> mutual fund</a>in <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India">India</a> occurred in 1963,

            href="">[1]</a>Mutual funds
        are broadly categorised into three segments:<a href="">equity funds</a>, hybrid funds, and<a href="">debt

        <p>The total <a href="">Assets Under Management</a>(AUM) of the Indian mutual fund industry as of December 31,
            2023, stood
            at a staggering <a href="">₹</a>50.78 trillion (US$600 billion). This is a significant milestone, marking
            over a
            six-fold increase compared to the <a href="">₹</a>8.26 trillion (US$98 billion) recorded in December 2013.<a
                href="">[2]</a></p>

    </li>
    <li>According to <a href="">SEBI</a>, during FY 2022–23, 73% of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_fund">
            mutual fund</a> units were redeemed within 2 years of investment.
        Only investments in 3% of the units continued for more than 5 years. <a href="">[3][4]</a></li>

    <li>
        <p></p>According to the <a href="">Reserve Bank of India</a> report, mutual funds attracted 6% of household
        savings in
        FY2023 and less than 1% went into direct equities. <a href="">[5][6][7]</a> Almost 95% of household savings in
        India park
        their money in <a href="">bank deposits</a>, including <a href="">fixed deposit, provident fund, PPF, life

    <li>
        <p>According to the <a href="">S&P</a> SPIVA Report FY2022, over a 10-year period, approximate 68% of the

<h2>Controversies</h2>
<hr>
<h3>List of Mutual fund companies/schemes bankrupted, defaulted or closed</h3>
<h3>2020 Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund fiasco</h3>
<p>In April 2020, <a href="">Franklin Templeton</a>India unexpectedly wound up
    six credit funds with assets of close to $4 billion, citing a lack of <a href="">liquidity</a>amid the <a
        href="">coronavirus pandemic.</a>
    These funds had large exposure
    to higher-yielding, lower-rated credit securities. The <a href="">Securities and Exchange Board of India</a>(SEBI)
    conducted
    a probe into this sudden closure and found “serious lapses and violations”. As a result, in June 2021, SEBI
    barred Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund from launching any new debt schemes for two years. The
    regulator also ordered the fund house to refund
    investment and advisory fees, along with interest, of more than 5 billion rupees, and fined the global giant
    another 50 million rupees. <a href="">[15][16][17][18]</a>

    Franklin Templeton said it strongly disagreed with the SEBI’s order
    and planned to appeal against it. The decision to wind up the schemes “was taken with the sole objective of
    preserving value for unitholders”, a
    spokesperson said. However, the closure of these funds sparked panic withdrawals from other Franklin Templeton
    schemes as well as credit funds of other asset managers, leading to a storm on social media and court cases by
    distraught investors. <a href="">[15][16][17][18]</a></p>
<h3>Reliance Mutual Fund</h3>
<p>In 2019, the debt schemes of Reliance Mutual Fund faced a liquidity crisis due
    to their exposure to troubled companies
    like Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL).
    This led to severe redemptions and forced
    asset sales, which significantly affected investors. <a href="">[20][19]</a></p>

<h3>IL&FS crisis and impact</h3>
<p>The IL&FS crisis in 2018 had a significant impact on the mutual fund industry, including
    those managed by IDBI Mutual Fund. The defaults by IL&FS led to a series of downgrades and defaults on its debt
    obligations and inter-corporate deposits1.
    This situation caused considerable distress in the financial markets and led to significant markdowns in the Net
    Asset Values (NAVs) of the affected mutual
    fund schemes, resulting in
    losses to investors. <a href="">[21][22][23]</a>

    The defaults by Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) triggered a liquidity crisis
    , making it difficult for mutual funds to meet redemption demands without selling assets at distressed prices.
    This event heightened concerns about credit risk, leading to
    widespread downgrades of IL&FS and other non-banking financial companies (NBFCs). Consequently, the net asset
    values (NAVs) of mutual funds holding these securities were
    adversely affected, reflecting the
    increased credit risk and decreased market confidence. <a href="">[24][25][26][27]</a></p>

<p>Investor confidence in debt mutual funds, particularly those with high exposure to
    NBFCs and infrastructure debt, was severely undermined. This led to significant outflows as investors moved
    towards safer
    and more liquid investment options. In response, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) introduced
    stricter regulations on
    sectoral exposure, single issuer limits, and the quality of collateral accepted in debt funds to enhance
    liquidity and reduce risks. Fund
    managers began focusing on higher-quality assets and improved
    risk management practices. The crisis underscored the need for better credit assessment and liquidity
    management, prompting regulatory reforms and a more cautious
    investment approach within the mutual fund industry.<a href="">[24][25][26][27]</a></p>

<h3>Amtek Auto Impact</h3>
<p>
    Several mutual funds, including those managed by JP Morgan Asset Management India, faced significant issues due
    to exposure to Amtek Auto, which defaulted on its debt in 2015. JP Morgan had to suspend redemptions and
    impose exit loads to manage the liquidity crisis. <a href="">[28][29][30]</a>
</p>
<h3>Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund (Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund)</h3>
<p>In 2018, Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund faced redemption pressures in some of its debt schemes due to exposure
    to entities like the
    Essel Group companies. The Economic Times reported that the Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund was the biggest
    investor in the Essel Group, with an exposure
    of Rs 2,936 crore spread across 28 schemes1. This accounted for almost 37% of the total debt fund exposure
    to the Zee group, which is part of the <a href="">Essel Group.[31]</a></p>

<h3>Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) crisis and impact</h3>
<p>The Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) crisis had a profound impact on the Indian mutual fund industry.
    DHFL's defaults created a severe
    liquidity crunch, making it difficult for mutual funds to meet redemption pressures without selling assets at
    heavily discounted prices. This crisis raised significant
    concerns about the creditworthiness of housing finance companies (HFCs) and non-banking financial companies
    (NBFCs), leading to downgrades of DHFL's debt instruments
    and adversely affecting
    the net asset values (NAVs) of mutual
    funds holding these securities. <a href="">[32][33][34][35]</a></p>
<p>Investor confidence in debt mutual funds, especially those with high exposure to HFCs and NBFCs, was severely
    shaken, resulting in substantial outflows
    as investors sought safer investments. In response, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) increased
    scrutiny and introduced tighter regulations on mutual funds' exposure to individual issuers and sectors to
    mitigate such risks in the future.
    Fund managers adjusted their
    portfolios by shifting towards higher-quality and more liquid assets, reducing exposure to high-risk debt
    instruments. The crisis underscored the importance of credit quality and
    liquidity management, prompting regulatory reforms and a more cautious approach within
    the mutual fund industry. <a href="">[32][33][34][35]</a></p>
<h3>2001 UTI Mutual Fund (Unit Trust of India) fiasco</h3>
<p>Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Limited (DHFL) defaulted on its debt obligations in 2019. This event led to
    significant
    governance concerns and defaults by DHFL in meeting various payment obligations,
    prompting the Reserve Bank of India to supersede the Board of Directors of DHFL1. The default affected several
    mutual funds,
    including those managed by BNP Paribas Asset Management India Private
    Limited, which had to mark down the value of their investments
    in DHFL’s securities. <a href="">[39][40][32][35]</a></p>
<p>The crisis deepened with rating downgrades and write-offs by mutual funds, which had a cumulative exposure of
    ₹5,336 crore to
    securities issued by DHFL3. As a result, there was a severe liquidity issue and a drop in the Net Asset Values
    (NAVs) of the mutual funds, impacting investors’ returns. DHFL
    Pramerica Mutual Fund, which was a joint venture between DHFL and Pramerica Financial, Inc., also faced
    challenges due to the exposure to DHFL’s
    debt instruments. <a href="">[39][40][32][35]</a></p>
<h3>Yes Mutual Fund</h3>
<p>In 2019, <a href="">Yes Bank</a> faced severe financial stress and was eventually placed under a moratorium by the
    Reserve Bank
    of India (RBI) in March 2020. This led to significant challenges for Yes Mutual Fund, particularly its debt
    schemes that had exposure to Yes Bank’s securities. The crisis necessitated write-downs and affected investor
    confidence. Around 32 mutual fund schemes had exposure to Yes Bank’s downgraded debt papers, with a total
    exposure amounting to approximately ₹2,848 crore. The crisis led to write-downs of these securities and impacted
    the net asset values (NAVs) of the mutual funds involved, which in turn affected investor
    confidence. <a href="">[41][42][43]</a></p>
<h3>Kotak Mutual Fund</h3>
<p>In 2019, Kotak Mutual Fund did face challenges with its Fixed Maturity Plans (FMPs) due to exposure to debt
    securities of companies like the Essel Group. The fund house was unable to redeem investments from these
    companies, which led to delays and partial rollovers of the FMPs. This situation affected the investors’
    expected returns. Consequently, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) barred Kotak from launching
    new FMPs for six months and imposed a fine for failing to abide by regulatory requirements.[44]</p>
<h3>HDFC Mutual Fund</h3>
<p>HDFC Mutual Fund did face a situation in 2018-2019 due to its exposure to companies like Essel Group and IL&FS.
    The credit events involving these companies led to significant mark-downs in the Net Asset Values (NAVs) of some
    of HDFC Mutual Fund’s debt schemes. This situation resulted in investor concerns and redemption
    pressures.[45][46]</p>
<p>To elaborate, the IL&FS crisis was one of the biggest financial crises in India, with the company defaulting on
    several of its obligations due to a cash shortfall. The debt involved was about Rs 1 lakh crore. Similarly,
    Essel Group companies were grappling with debt woes, which put mutual funds, including HDFC, under redemption
    pressure. However, HDFC Mutual Fund later recovered the entire investment made in the non-convertible debentures
    issued by Essel Group companies.[45][46]</p>
<h3>Sahara Mutual Fund</h3>
<p>SEBI conducted an examination to determine whether Sahara Mutual Fund, its Asset Management Company, and its
    trustees were ‘fit and proper’ as per regulatory standards. This was in light of a previous SEBI order from 2011
    concerning two other Sahara entities, which were directed to refund money collected through Optionally Fully
    Convertible Debentures (OFCDs) to investors.[47][48]</p>
<p>In 2015, SEBI ordered the winding up of Sahara Mutual Fund’s schemes due to non-compliance with regulatory
    requirements. The regulatory scrutiny and legal challenges indeed led to operational difficulties and affected
    investor confidence in the fund house.[49][50]</p>
<h2>Market segment</h2>
<hr>
<p>Despite being available in the market,[51] a recent report on Mutual Fund Investments in India published by
    research and analytics firm, Boston Analytics, suggests investors are holding back from putting their money into
    mutual funds due to their perceived high risk and a lack of information on how mutual funds work.[52] There are
    46 Mutual Funds as of June 2013.[53] In 2019, Asset under management (AUM) of the mutual fund industry rose by
    13% to 24 trillion in 2018 by November[54] The total assets under management (AUM) has surged by around 23.43%
    in 2023. The Assets base in January 2023 was Rs.40.70lakh crores, which rose to Rs.50.24 lakh crore in Nov,
    23.[55]</p>
<h2>Average assets under management</h2>
<hr>
<p>Assets under management (AUM) is a financial term denoting the market value of all the funds being managed by a
    financial institution (a mutual fund, hedge fund, private equity firm, venture capital firm, or brokerage house)
    on behalf of its clients, investors, partners, depositors, etc.</p>
<p>The average assets under management of all mutual funds in India for the quarter Dec 2015 to Mar 2016(in ₹ Lakh)
    is given below:[56][57] or [58]</p>
