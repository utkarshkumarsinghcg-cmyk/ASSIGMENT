    <h1>The History of Computers and the Internet</h1>
    <h2>Early Computers</h2>
    <p>The journey of <b>computers</b> began with devices like the <i>abacus</i> and Charles Babbage’s
        <u>Analytical Engine</u>. These early designs laid the foundation for modern machines.
        In the 1940s, the <abbr title="Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer">ENIAC</abbr>
        was created, one of the first electronic computers.
        It used thousands of vacuum tubes and was mainly designed for military calculations.
        A famous saying goes: <q>Computers are incredibly fast, accurate, and stupid; humans are incredibly slow,
            inaccurate, and brilliant; together they are powerful.</q>
    </p>
    <h2>Generations of Computers</h2>
    <p>The history of computers is divided into <strong>five generations</strong>:
        <mark>vacuum tubes</mark>, <mark>transistors</mark>, <mark>integrated circuits</mark>,
        <mark>microprocessors</mark>, and <mark>artificial intelligence</mark>.
        For example, in physics formulas like E = mc<sup>2</sup>, we use computers to solve
        complex equations, while chemistry uses formulas such as H<sub>2</sub>O for water.
        Old prices of computers were very high $5000, but now modern systems can be bought
        for as low as <ins>$500</ins>.
    </p>
    <h2>Birth of the Internet</h2>
    <p>The <mark>Internet</mark> originated in the late <q>1960s as a U.S. defense project called ARPANET</q>. It was
        designed to connect computers across different <u><b>universities and research labs</b></u>. Over time,
        networking technologies improved, leading to the development of TCP/IP protocols in the 1980s, which became the
        backbone of modern Internet communication. By the 1990s, the invention of the World Wide Web (WWW) by Tim
        Berners-Lee transformed the Internet into a platform accessible to the general public, allowing websites, email,
        and online communities to flourish.</p>

    <h2>Modern Era</h2>
    <p>
        Today, computers and the Internet are everywhere. We write programs using
        <code>print("Hello, World!")</code> or in C with
        <code>printf("Hello World");</code>.
        When saving code, we use shortcuts like <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd>.
        The output of a program could be as simple as: <samp>Hello World</samp>.
        In mathematics, if <var>x</var> = 10 and <var>y</var> = 5, then
        computers instantly calculate <var>x</var> + <var>y</var> = 15.
        This power makes the modern era of computing and the Internet truly revolutionary.

   "The power of the Web is in its universality. 
   Access by everyone regardless of disability is 
   an essential aspect."
